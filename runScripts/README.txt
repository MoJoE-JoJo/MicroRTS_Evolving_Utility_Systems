Instructions for running the compiled jar file:

Included is 3 scripts

- startFrontend.bat: boots up the GUI window to play around with microRTS
- startQuicktest.bat: runs a mini evolution from baseline against baseline to see if everything works.
- startAllTests: runs all the tests described in the paper.


if you want to run with your own config, it can be done with the following command:

    'java -cp MicroRTS_EUS.jar properties\utility_system_properties\quickTest.properties'

Where the quickTest.properties is then replaced with the properties file you want to run.
Either modify one of the script files or run it form a terminal
